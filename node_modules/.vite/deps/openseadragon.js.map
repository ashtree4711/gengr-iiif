This is a complex parameter; see\n  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.Viewer#open} for details.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [tabIndex=0]\n  *     Tabbing order index to assign to the viewer element. Positive values are selected in increasing order. When tabIndex is 0\n  *     source order is used. A negative value omits the viewer from the tabbing order.\n  *\n  * @property {Array} overlays Array of objects defining permanent overlays of\n  *     the viewer. The overlays added via this option and later removed with\n  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.Viewer#removeOverlay} will be added back when a new\n  *     image is opened.\n  *     To add overlays which can be definitively removed, one must use\n  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.Viewer#addOverlay}\n  *     If displaying a sequence of images, the overlays can be associated\n  *     with a specific page by passing the overlays array to the page's\n  *     tile source configuration.\n  *     Expected properties:\n  *     * x, y, (or px, py for pixel coordinates) to define the location.\n  *     * width, height in point if using x,y or in pixels if using px,py.

Default: 'TOP_LEFT'.\n  *       See {@link OpenSeadragon.Placement} for possible values.\n  *\n  * @property {String} [xmlPath=null]\n  *     <strong>DEPRECATED</strong>. A relative path to load a DZI file from the server.\n  *     Prefer the newer Options.tileSources.\n  *\n  * @property {String} [prefixUrl='/images/']\n  *     Prepends the prefixUrl to navImages paths, which is very useful\n  *     since the default paths are rarely useful for production\n  *     environments.\n  *\n  * @property {OpenSeadragon.NavImages} [navImages]\n  *     An object with a property for each button or other built-in navigation\n  *     control, eg the current 'zoomIn', 'zoomOut', 'home', and 'fullpage'.\n  *     Each of those in turn provides an image path for each state of the button\n  *     or navigation control, eg 'REST', 'GROUP', 'HOVER', 'PRESS'. Finally the\n  *     image paths, by default assume there is a folder on the servers root path\n  *     called '/images', eg '/images/zoomin_rest.png'.  If you need to adjust\n  *     these paths, prefer setting the option.prefixUrl rather than overriding\n  *     every image path directly through this setting.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [debugMode=false]\n  *     TODO: provide an in-screen panel providing event detail feedback.\n  *\n  * @property {String} [debugGridColor=['#437AB2', '#1B9E77', '#D95F02', '#7570B3', '#E7298A', '#66A61E', '#E6AB02', '#A6761D', '#666666']]\n  *     The colors of grids in debug mode. Each tiled image's grid uses a consecutive color.\n  *     If there are more tiled images than provided colors, the color vector is recycled.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [silenceMultiImageWarnings=false]\n  *     Silences warnings when calling viewport coordinate functions with multi-image.\n  *     Useful when you're overlaying multiple images on top of one another.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [blendTime=0]\n  *     Specifies the duration of animation as higher or lower level tiles are\n  *     replacing the existing tile.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [alwaysBlend=false]\n  *     Forces the tile to always blend.  By default the tiles skip blending\n  *     when the blendTime is surpassed and the current animation frame would\n  *     not complete the blend.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [autoHideControls=true]\n  *     If the user stops interacting with the viewport, fade the navigation\n  *     controls.  Useful for presentation since the controls are by default\n  *     floated on top of the image the user is viewing.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [immediateRender=false]\n  *     Render the best closest level first, ignoring the lowering levels which\n  *     provide the effect of very blurry to sharp. It is recommended to change\n  *     setting to true for mobile devices.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [defaultZoomLevel=0]\n  *     Zoom level to use when image is first opened or the home button is clicked.\n  *     If 0, adjusts to fit viewer.\n  *\n  * @property {String|DrawerImplementation|Array} [drawer = ['auto', 'webgl', 'canvas', 'html']]\n  *     Which drawer to use. Valid strings are 'auto', 'webgl', 'canvas', and 'html'.\n  *     The string 'auto' is converted to one or more drawer type strings depending\n  *     on the platform. On iOS-like devices it becomes 'canvas' due to performance\n  *     limitations with the webgl drawer. On all other platforms it becomes ['webgl', 'canvas']\n  *     meaning that webgl is tried first, and canvas is available as a fallback if webgl is not supported.\n  *\n  *     The 'webgl' drawer automatically uses WebGL2 when available, falling back to WebGL1.\n  *\n  *     External drawer plugins can register additional drawer types as strings.\n  *     Valid drawer implementations are constructors of classes that extend OpenSeadragon.DrawerBase.\n  *     An array of strings and/or constructors can be used to indicate the priority\n  *     of different implementations, which will be tried in order based on browser support.\n  *     The 'webgl' drawer can automatically fall back to canvas as needed, for example to draw\n  *     images that do not have CORS headers set which makes them tainted and unavailable to webgl.\n  *     This behavior depends on 'canvas' being included in the list of drawer candidates. If\n  *     webgl is needed and canvas fallback is not desired, use 'webgl' without including 'canvas' in the list.\n  *\n  * @property {Object} drawerOptions\n  *     Options to pass to the selected drawer implementation. For details\n  *     please see {@link OpenSeadragon.DrawerOptions}.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [opacity=1]\n  *     Default proportional opacity of the tiled images (1=opaque, 0=hidden)\n  *     Hidden images do not draw and only load when preloading is allowed.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [preload=false]\n  *     Default switch for loading hidden images (true loads, false blocks)\n  *\n  * @property {String} [compositeOperation=null]\n  *     Valid values are 'source-over', 'source-atop', 'source-in', 'source-out',\n  *     'destination-over', 'destination-atop', 'destination-in', 'destination-out',\n  *     'lighter', 'difference', 'copy', 'xor', etc.\n  *     For complete list of modes, please @see {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation/ globalCompositeOperation}\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [imageSmoothingEnabled=true]\n  *     Image smoothing for rendering. Supported by the canvas and webgl drawers,\n  *     and may also be supported by external drawer plugins. Note: Ignored by some\n  *     (especially older) browsers which do not support this canvas property.\n  *     This property can be changed in {@link Viewer.DrawerBase.setImageSmoothingEnabled}.\n  *\n  * @property {String|CanvasGradient|CanvasPattern|Function} [placeholderFillStyle=null]\n  *     Draws a colored rectangle behind the tile if it is not loaded yet.\n  *     You can pass a CSS color value like \"#FF8800\".\n  *     When passing a function the tiledImage and canvas context are available as argument which is useful when you draw a gradient or pattern.\n  *\n  * @property {Object} [subPixelRoundingForTransparency=null]\n  *     Determines when subpixel rounding should be applied for tiles when rendering images that support transparency.\n  *     This property is a subpixel rounding enum values dictionary [{@link BROWSERS}] --> {@link SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES}.\n  *     The key is a {@link BROWSERS} value, and the value is one of {@link SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES},\n  *     indicating, for a given browser, when to apply subpixel rounding.\n  *     Key '*' is the fallback value for any browser not specified in the dictionary.\n  *     This property has a simple mode, and one can set it directly to\n  *     {@link SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES.NEVER}, {@link SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES.ONLY_AT_REST} or {@link SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES.ALWAYS}\n  *     in order to apply this rule for all browser. The values {@link SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES.ALWAYS} would be equivalent to { '*', SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES.ALWAYS }.\n  *     The default is {@link SUBPIXEL_ROUNDING_OCCURRENCES.NEVER} for all browsers, for backward compatibility reason.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [degrees=0]\n  *     Initial rotation.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [flipped=false]\n  *     Initial flip state.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [overlayPreserveContentDirection=true]\n  *     When the viewport is flipped (by pressing 'f'), the overlay is flipped using ScaleX.\n  *     Normally, this setting (default true) keeps the overlay's content readable by flipping it back.\n  *     To make the content flip with the overlay, set overlayPreserveContentDirection to false.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [minZoomLevel=null]\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [maxZoomLevel=null]\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [homeFillsViewer=false]\n  *     Make the 'home' button fill the viewer and clip the image, instead\n  *     of fitting the image to the viewer and letterboxing.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [panHorizontal=true]\n  *     Allow horizontal pan.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [panVertical=true]\n  *     Allow vertical pan.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [constrainDuringPan=false]\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [wrapHorizontal=false]\n  *     Set to true to force the image to wrap horizontally within the viewport.\n  *     Useful for maps or images representing the surface of a sphere or cylinder.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [wrapVertical=false]\n  *     Set to true to force the image to wrap vertically within the viewport.\n  *     Useful for maps or images representing the surface of a sphere or cylinder.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [minZoomImageRatio=0.9]\n  *     The minimum percentage ( expressed as a number between 0 and 1 ) of\n  *     the viewport height or width at which the zoom out will be constrained.\n  *     Setting it to 0, for example will allow you to zoom out infinity.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [maxZoomPixelRatio=1.1]\n  *     The maximum ratio to allow a zoom-in to affect the highest level pixel\n  *     ratio. This can be set to Infinity to allow 'infinite' zooming into the\n  *     image though it is less effective visually if the HTML5 Canvas is not\n  *     available on the viewing device.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [smoothTileEdgesMinZoom=1.1]\n  *     A zoom percentage ( where 1 is 100% ) of the highest resolution level.\n  *     When zoomed in beyond this value alternative compositing will be used to\n  *     smooth out the edges between tiles. This will have a performance impact.\n  *     Can be set to Infinity to turn it off.\n  *     Note: This setting is ignored on iOS devices due to a known bug (See {@link https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon/issues/952})\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [iOSDevice=?]\n  *     True if running on an iOS device, false otherwise.\n  *     Used to disable certain features that behave differently on iOS devices.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [autoResize=true]\n  *     Set to false to prevent polling for viewer size changes. Useful for providing custom resize behavior.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [preserveImageSizeOnResize=false]\n  *     Set to true to have the image size preserved when the viewer is resized. This requires autoResize=true (default).\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [minScrollDeltaTime=50]\n  *     Number of milliseconds between canvas-scroll events. This value helps normalize the rate of canvas-scroll\n  *     events between different devices, causing the faster devices to slow down enough to make the zoom control\n  *     more manageable.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [rotationIncrement=90]\n  *     The number of degrees to rotate right or left when the rotate buttons or keyboard shortcuts are activated.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [maxTilesPerFrame=1]\n  *     The number of tiles loaded per frame. As the frame rate of the client's machine is usually high (e.g., 50 fps),\n  *     one tile per frame should be a good choice. However, for large screens or lower frame rates, the number of\n  *     loaded tiles per frame can be adjusted here. Reasonable values might be 2 or 3 tiles per frame.\n  *     (Note that the actual frame rate is given by the client's browser and machine).\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [pixelsPerWheelLine=40]\n  *     For pixel-resolution scrolling devices, the number of pixels equal to one scroll line.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [pixelsPerArrowPress=40]\n  *     The number of pixels viewport moves when an arrow key is pressed.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [visibilityRatio=0.5]\n  *     The percentage ( as a number from 0 to 1 ) of the source image which\n  *     must be kept within the viewport.  If the image is dragged beyond that\n  *     limit, it will 'bounce' back until the minimum visibility ratio is\n  *     achieved.  Setting this to 0 and wrapHorizontal ( or wrapVertical ) to\n  *     true will provide the effect of an infinitely scrolling viewport.\n  *\n  * @property {Object} [viewportMargins={}]\n  *     Pushes the \"home\" region in from the sides by the specified amounts.\n  *     Possible subproperties (Numbers, in screen coordinates): left, top, right, bottom.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [imageLoaderLimit=0]\n  *     The maximum number of image requests to make concurrently. By default\n  *     it is set to 0 allowing the browser to make the maximum number of\n  *     image requests in parallel as allowed by the browsers policy.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [clickTimeThreshold=300]\n  *      The number of milliseconds within which a pointer down-up event combination\n  *      will be treated as a click gesture.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [clickDistThreshold=5]\n  *      The maximum distance allowed between a pointer down event and a pointer up event\n  *      to be treated as a click gesture.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [dblClickTimeThreshold=300]\n  *      The number of milliseconds within which two pointer down-up event combinations\n  *      will be treated as a double-click gesture.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [dblClickDistThreshold=20]\n  *      The maximum distance allowed between two pointer click events\n  *      to be treated as a double-click gesture.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [springStiffness=6.5]\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [animationTime=1.2]\n  *     Specifies the animation duration per each {@link OpenSeadragon.Spring}\n  *     which occur when the image is dragged, zoomed or rotated.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [loadDestinationTilesOnAnimation=true]\n  *    If true, tiles are loaded only at the destination of an animation.\n  *    If false, tiles are loaded along the animation path during the animation.\n  * @property {OpenSeadragon.GestureSettings} [gestureSettingsMouse]\n  *     Settings for gestures generated by a mouse pointer device.

Do not instantiate\n * this class, use OpenSeadragon.converter - a global instance, instead.\n *\n * Types are defined to closely describe the data type, e.g. \"url\" is insufficient,\n * because url can point to many different data types. Another bad example is 'canvas'\n * as canvas can have different underlying rendering implementations and thus differ\n * in behavior. The following data types supported by\n * OpenSeadragon core are:\n * - \"image\" - HTMLImageElement, an <image> object\n * - \"context2d\" - HtmlRenderingContext2D, a 2D canvas context\n * - \"rasterBlob\" - Blob, a binary file-like object carrying image data\n * - \"imageBitmap\" - an ImageBitmap object\n *\n * The system uses these to deliver desired data from TileSource (which implements fetching logics)\n * through plugins to the renderer with preserving data type compatibility. Typical example is:\n *  TiledImage downloads and creates Image object with type 'image'. It submits\n *  to the system object of data type 'image'. The system runs this object through\n *  possible plugins integrated into the invalidation routine (by default none),\n *  and finishes by conversion for the WebGL renderer, which would most likely be \"image\"\n *  object, because the conversion in this case is not even necessary, as the drawer publishes\n *  the image type as one of its supported ones.\n *  If some plugin required context2d type, the pipeline would deliver this type and used\n *  it also for WebGL, as texture loading function accepts canvas object as well as image.\n *\n * @class OpenSeadragon.DataTypeConverter\n * @memberOf OpenSeadragon\n */\nOpenSeadragon.DataTypeConverter = class DataTypeConverter {\n\n    constructor() {\n        this.graph = new WeightedGraph();\n        this.destructors = {};\n        this.copyings = {};\n\n        // Teaching OpenSeadragon built-in conversions:\n        const imageCreator = (tile, url) => new $.Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n            if (!$.supportsAsync) {\n                return reject(\"Not supported in sync mode!\");\n            }\n            const img = new Image();\n            img.onerror = img.onabort = e => reject(`Failed to load image: ${url}`);\n            img.onload = () => resolve(img);\n            if (tile.tiledImage && tile.tiledImage.crossOriginPolicy) {\n                img.crossOrigin = tile.tiledImage.crossOriginPolicy;\n            }\n            img.src = url;\n            return undefined;\n        });\n        const canvasContextCreator = (tile, imageData) => {\n            const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\n            canvas.width = imageData.width;\n            canvas.height = imageData.height;\n            const context = canvas.getContext('2d', { willReadFrequently: true });\n            context.drawImage(imageData, 0, 0);\n            return context;\n        };\n\n        this.learn(\"rasterBlob\", \"image\", (tile, blob) => new $.Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n            // eslint-disable-next-line compat/compat\n            const url = (window.URL || window.webkitURL).createObjectURL(blob);\n            if (!$.supportsAsync) {\n                return reject(\"Not supported in sync mode!\");\n            }\n            const img = new Image();\n            img.onerror = img.onabort = e => {\n                // eslint-disable-next-line compat/compat\n                (window.URL || window.webkitURL).revokeObjectURL(blob);\n                reject(e);\n            };\n            img.onload = () => {\n                // eslint-disable-next-line compat/compat\n                (window.URL || window.webkitURL).revokeObjectURL(blob);\n                resolve(img);\n            };\n            img.decoding = 'async';\n            img.src = url;\n            return undefined;\n        }), 1, 2);\n\n        this.learn(\"context2d\", \"rasterBlob\", (tile, ctx) => new $.Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n            if (!$.supportsAsync) {\n                return reject(\"Not supported in sync mode!\");\n            }\n            ctx.canvas.toBlob(resolve);\n            return undefined;\n        }), 1, 2);\n\n        // rasterBlob -> imageBitmap (preferred fast path)\n        this.learn(\"rasterBlob\", \"imageBitmap\", (tile, blob) => new $.Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n            if (!$.supportsAsync) {\n                return reject(\"Not supported in sync mode!\");\n            }\n            if (_imageConversionWorker) {\n                postWorker('decodeFromBlob', { blob }).then(resolve).catch(reject);\n            } else {\n                // Fallback main thread\n                createImageBitmap(blob, { colorSpaceConversion: 'none' }).then(resolve).catch(reject);\n            }\n            return undefined;\n        }), 1, 1);\n\n        this.learn(\"imageBitmap\", \"context2d\", (tile, bmp) => {\n            const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\n            canvas.width = bmp.width;\n            canvas.height = bmp.height;\n            const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d', { willReadFrequently: true });\n            ctx.drawImage(bmp, 0, 0);\n            return ctx;\n        }, 1, 2);\n\n        this.learn(\"image\", \"imageBitmap\", (tile, img) => {\n            return createImageBitmap(img, { colorSpaceConversion: 'none' });\n        }, 1, 2);\n        this.learn(\"image\", \"context2d\", canvasContextCreator, 1, 2);\n\n        //Copies\n        this.learn(\"image\", \"image\", (tile, image) => imageCreator(tile, image.src), 1, 1);\n        this.learn(\"context2d\", \"context2d\", (tile, ctx) => canvasContextCreator(tile, ctx.canvas));\n        this.learn(\"rasterBlob\", \"rasterBlob\", (tile, blob) => blob, 0, 1);
